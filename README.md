# Mister Rogers Ipsum
Responsive Mister Rogers text generator

I started this project because wanted to use css, javascript and jQuery to create a custom Lorum Ipsum generator. Inspired by the always soothing and elequent Mister Rogers, I decided to give his voice to my text.

I've created a functional slider, toggle, and button to generate randomized paragraphs for designers and developers to use as placeholder text. Though the most important aspect was a customized functionality, I also added animated text and a simple color palette inspired by Mister Rogers' famous red sweater.
